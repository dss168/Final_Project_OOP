# Final_Project_OOP
#
# Hello, and welcome to Daniel Schement's final project!
# The included program is a game of Go Fish!
# The program will let you know what your hand is, automatically draw cards for you, and play for the computer, and will keep you updated on what's happening throughout the game.
#
# Go Fish works like this:
# You and your opponent are dealt seven cards out of a full deck of 52 cards. You then decide who goes first. In this case, you do. After that, you ask your opponent if they have any of a card type you have in your hand, for instance, sevens or aces. If they do, they give you those cards and you go again. If not, you draw a card.
#
# You gain points by putting together books. A book is a collection of all four of a card type, like all four eights or kings. If you get a book when drawing a card, you also get to go again. Keep that in mind!
#
# After your turn, the computer will go through theirs, then it will go back to you. This will repeat until either one of you has an empty hand or the deck is empty.
#
# When the game is over, the program will let you know who won.
#
# To play the game, just follow the in prompt instructions. They'll let you know what you're available commands are. Remember to capitalize your responses, and when asking for cards, list them in plural, such as 'Sixes,' or 'Twos.'
#
# Have fun, and good luck!
